ESP-32 with TDS-Sensor

In this project, we  are using a TDS meter (Total Dissolved Solids) with the ESP32. A TDS meter indicates the total dissolved solids like salts, minerals, and metals, in a solution. This parameter can be used to give you an idea of water quality and compare water from different sources. One of the main applications of a TDS meter is aquarium water quality monitoring.

Introducing the TDS Meter

A TDS meter measures the number of total dissolved solids like salts, minerals, and metals in the water. As the number of dissolved solids in the water increases, the conductivity of the water increases, and that allow us to calculate the total dissolved solids in ppm (mg/L).

Although this is a good indicator to monitor the quality of the water, note that it does not measure contaminants in the water. Thus, you can’t rely solely on this indicator to determine if the water is good for consumption or not.

A TDS meter can be useful to monitor water quality in many applications like pools, aquariums, fish tanks, hydroponics, water purifiers, etc.

The Output is displayed in the Serial Monitor.
